# **BetterBooks**

BetterBooks is a book site. It allows users to search for books by author, keywords, and isbn. Users can also submit reviews for books and give ratings, which are visible to everyone. 

I built this website to learn the basics of Flask, SQL, HTML, CSS, and how to use all of them together. I was able to learn a lot of fundamental skills, such as templating, login systems, links, and querying databases. 

### **Technologies Used:**
- Python (Flask, sqlalchemy)
- HTML (Jinja2)
- CSS
- Postgresql
